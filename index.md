## Introduction

I'm Minrui Yang, but I mostly go by Wally.

I'm a Production Engineer (or Site-Reliability Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, DevOps, depending who you talk to or what compnay).

I enjoy solving system/infrastructure problems, whether it's low-level programming with POSIX, or managing modern infrastructure with containers, VM, and occasionally physical hosts.

Rust is my preferred programming language, although I understand the cases for and willing to use Golang, Python, C++, etc.
However, I strongly believe that anything that can be rewritten in Rust should be rewritten in Rust, convince me otherwise :).

#### NOTE to Recruiters

If you'd like to reach out to me, please include remote work info about your company/client. I don't plan to relocate any time soon.

There's a lot of people just using automatic email to reach out. This is also how I know you're not using a template message and actually looked at my profile
